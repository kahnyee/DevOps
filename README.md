# Automated Gardening System
## The Automated Gardening System will support the monitoring and control of a hydroponics system for optimal plant growth.

The following parameters are monitored continuously:

- pH level of the solution
- Ambient temperature
- Relative humidity
- Ambient lighting intensity
- EC level

### The automated hydroponics system will be a closed loop system where the EC level is constantly adjusted to maintain the pre-set optimal level.

- When the EC level is too low, additional nutrient solution will be dispensed into the hydroponics solution by activating a pump based on a servo motor.

### When the light intensity level is too low, a UV light will be activated.

- The light intensity will also be controlled based on the measured ambient lighting intensity to ensure that plants have optimal lighting at all times.

### When the ambient temperature gets too high, a fan is activated to reduce the ambient temperature.

- Ambient temperature in the hydroponics system is also maintained at a constant level as much as possible.

### To visualise the data from the different sensors a dashboard will be implemented via web page.
